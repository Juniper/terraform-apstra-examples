# Introduction
This set of terraform configs that track the terraform lab [here](https://cloudlabs.apstra.com/labguide/Cloudlabs/4.1.2/lab-terraform/labTF-1-intro.html)
These were used in this [podcast](https://youtu.be/oD3-8CPO9MA) by @chrismarget-j and @rajagopalans
They deploy the components required for a blueprint and then the blueprint itself as part of the Terraform Apstra lab.

# Usage
- Please follow the steps in the README in the root directory.
- The local variable "switches" in the blueprint.tf file needs to be set up correctly.
